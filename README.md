## ✨ Key Features

Our Personal Finance Tracker is built around five core functionalities to ensure a comprehensive financial management experience:

1.  **Expense Tracking:**

      * **Simple Input:** Effortlessly add new transactions on the go.
      * **Intelligent Categorization:** Assign expenses to custom or predefined categories (e.g., Groceries, Utilities, Entertainment) for clear organization.
      * **Date and Location Tagging:** Record the precise details of every transaction.

2.  **Budget Creation & Management:**

      * **Category-Specific Budgets:** Set spending limits for various categories (e.g., $500 for Food, $150 for Transport).
      * **Real-Time Tracking:** Visualize your spending progress against your set budgets with status bars and alerts.
      * **Rollover Options:** Option to roll over surplus or deficit budget amounts into the next period.

3.  **Comprehensive Financial Reports:**

      * **Periodic Summaries:** Generate detailed reports (monthly, quarterly, or custom date ranges) to analyze spending habits.
      * **Visual Data:** View financial data through customizable charts (pie charts, bar graphs) to easily identify trends and outliers.
      * **Export Functionality:** Export reports in common formats (CSV, PDF) for external use or tax purposes.

4.  **Goal Setting & Progress Tracking:**

      * **Custom Financial Goals:** Define specific financial objectives, such as saving for a down payment, paying off debt, or building an emergency fund.
      * **Milestone Tracking:** Break down large goals into smaller, manageable milestones.
      * **Automated Contributions:** Set up simulated automatic "contributions" towards your goals based on your available cash flow.

5.  **Payment Reminders:**

      * **Due Date Alerts:** Receive timely notifications for upcoming bills and recurring payments (e.g., rent, credit card, subscriptions).
      * **Customizable Frequency:** Set reminders for weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payments.
      * **Avoid Late Fees:** Never miss a due date again, helping to maintain a healthy credit score.
